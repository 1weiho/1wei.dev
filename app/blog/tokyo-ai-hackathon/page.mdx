## Tokyo AI Hackathon

Last month, [Yen](https://x.com/ridemountainpig) and I flew to Tokyo to join the Tokyo AI Hackathon, hosted by [Raycast Community Japan](https://x.com/Raycast0731). It was my first time traveling abroad for a community event, so the excitement was off the charts.

We arrived early on the day of the event to meet [Thomas](https://x.com/thomaspaulmann), [Pedro](https://x.com/peduarte), and Stephanie at their hotel, after following Raycast for so long and only seeing them on X or YouTube, finally meeting them in person felt surreal, almost dreamlike.

### The Hackathon

The challenge of the hackathon was simple but thrilling: build a Raycast AI Extension on the spot, and see who could come up with the most creative and impactful idea. I knew right away that I wanted to make something different, something that would stand out.

I wondered: Could I turn Raycast AI Chat into a real **Vibe Coding** tool through an AI Extension?

So I started building my first tool — `list-dir`. The moment it ran successfully and began listing the directory structure layer by layer, I got instantly hooked. From there, I added `read-file`, `apply-edit`, `grep`, and other tools commonly used by agents.

Bit by bit, it started behaving like a mini version of Cursor: it could understand my project, follow my instructions, and even apply changes directly to the code.

After several rounds of judging, I was incredibly honored to win third place. Huge thanks to all the judges! If you'd like to try the extension yourself, you can check it out here:

### After the event

Beyond the hackathon itself, I was really happy that this event gave me the chance to finally meet [Florentin](https://x.com/ecklflorentin) from Vercel. He shared how Vercel uses Raycast internally and how they build their own extensions, which was super inspiring.

I also had great conversations with [Javi](https://x.com/javivelasco) and [Matthew](https://x.com/abeanstalker) from Vercel. They talked with me about career paths, personal growth, and many other topics. Everyone was incredibly kind and open, it really meant a lot.

### Wrap-up

I'm truly grateful to Raycast Community Japan for organizing such a fantastic event. This trip allowed me to meet so many amazing people and gave me the rare chance to practice speaking English, something I don't get to do often back in Taiwan.

I'm already looking forward to joining more international community events in the future. Can't wait to meet everyone again!
